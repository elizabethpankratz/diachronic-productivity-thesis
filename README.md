# Quantifying diachronic productivity (M.A. thesis)

This repository contains the data and R scripts used for my M.A. thesis project, done at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in the summer semester 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Anke Lüdeling.

It also contains the pdf file of the thesis itself, as well as the slides for the presentation I gave at the HU's corpus linguistics colloquium on June 12, 2019.

The subdirectory `scripts-and-data` contains:

- the R scripts used to analyse my data (the main script that runs the analysis is `thesis_analysis.R`, the others supplement that one)
- a subdirectory `r-analysis`, which contains:
	- the original samples for -er, -heit/-keit, and -ung from RIDGES as well as for -heit/-keit from DECOW16B
	- analyses of the samples in csv format

These analyses include:

|	| Entire samples | Per subperiod | Per text |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| basic info tables | x | x | x |
| lemma frequency lists | x | x | x |
| frequency spectra | x | x | x |
| rank-frequency profiles | x | x | x |
| empirical VGCs | x | x | x |
| interpolated VGCs | x | x | x |
| extrapolated VGCs (fZM model) | x |  |  |
| Monte Carlo overview for PP | x |  |  |
| Monte Carlo overview for S | x |  |  |
