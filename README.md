# Quantifying diachronic productivity (M.A. thesis)

This repository will contain the data and R scripts used for my M.A. thesis project, done at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in the summer semester 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Anke Lüdeling.

For now, it contains the slides for the presentation I gave at the HU's corpus linguistics colloquium on June 12, 2019.
